# Advent of Code

2022 is my first stab at participating in a competitive scripting event.

As I am not a developer of code, but a scripter who uses code to make his life easier through automation, it will be an interesting journey of writing code in a more efficient way as i progress.

My entry into the AoC will be by using Python, as that is a language i am looking to develop further and see this as a great chance to do so; as my background is PowerShell, but have been amazed by the immense libraries Python has to offer.
